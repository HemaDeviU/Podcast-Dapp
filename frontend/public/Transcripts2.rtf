00:00:40.000 all of our regular episodes without\
00:00:42.000 sponsor messages okay so do you remember\
00:00:44.000 the big messy fights this year over the\
00:00:46.000 US debt limit the US has hit its debt\
00:00:48.000 ceiling Congress and the White House are\
00:00:50.000 in a standoff the impass could end in a\
00:00:52.000 federal default and economic disaster\
00:00:54.000 here is what Yesa yadav a professor at\
00:00:56.000 Vanderbilt University's law school told\
00:00:58.000 me about it at the time we look like\
00:01:00.000 idiots to the rest of the world I mean I\
00:01:02.000 think there's no other way to put it\
00:01:04.000 that we are playing with our own\
00:01:06.000 National economy luckily that will never\
00:01:08.000 happen again I'm just kidding the debt\
00:01:10.000 limit was suspended until\
00:01:12.000 2025 so year after next we might be\
00:01:14.000 watching the very same fight again and\
00:01:16.000 for economists and Market experts like\
00:01:18.000 yesi adav it's a hard fight to watch\
00:01:20.000 because it could compromise something\
00:01:22.000 hugely important to the economy the\
00:01:24.000 Safety and Security of the US Treasury\
00:01:26.000 Market treasuries are US Government debt\
00:01:28.000 they're called treasuries CU you come\
00:01:30.000 from the treasury Department do you get\
00:01:32.000 it when the US government sells a\
00:01:34.000 treasury it's saying hey you give me\
00:01:36.000 some money I'll pay you back later and\
00:01:38.000 I'll give you these little interest\
00:01:40.000 payments along the way to make it worth\
00:01:42.000 your while so we have an asset that's\
00:01:44.000 supposed to be default free that the US\
00:01:46.000 will always pay its debts on time it's\
00:01:48.000 an asset you can trade super in uh and\
00:01:50.000 out off which means you can turn it into\
00:01:52.000 cash whenever you want and the US uses\
00:01:54.000 the money to fund basically everything\
00:01:56.000 the interstate the post office the\
00:01:58.000 different water sources that you use\
00:02:00.000 we're using the money to essentially\
00:02:02.000 fund our daily\
00:02:04.000 live treasuries US Government debt they\
00:02:06.000 make life as we know it possible they\
00:02:08.000 also help fund our big beautiful\
00:02:10.000 bailouts and our Federal Reserve lending\
00:02:12.000 programs on top of all of that\
00:02:14.000 treasuries are crucial to keeping the\
00:02:16.000 entire Financial system functioning they\
00:02:18.000 are a super powerful and important tool\
00:02:20.000 but also the market for them may be more\
00:02:22.000 fragile than we know in this episode we\
00:02:24.000 are going to talk about why this\
00:02:26.000 conversation is like many that we bring\
00:02:28.000 you in Planet Money plus bonus episodes\
00:02:30.000 it's the kind that we have with many\
00:02:32.000 really smart people all the time\
00:02:34.000 portions go into our regular episodes\
00:02:36.000 but our supporters get to hear a much\
00:02:38.000 longer version so here is my\
00:02:40.000 conversation with Yesa\
00:02:42.000 [Music]\
00:02:44.000 yev can you tell me what benefit we\
00:02:46.000 derive from having treasuries be so\
00:02:48.000 risk-free we derive just this Superstar\
00:02:50.000 ability to\
00:02:52.000 borrow you know this is a way in which\
00:02:54.000 we can reliably Finance ourselves\
00:02:56.000 without looking to taxpayers to foot the\
00:02:58.000 bill um and it's also super helpful in\
00:03:00.000 situations where every other part of the\
00:03:02.000 financial architecture is falling apart\
00:03:04.000 so because treasuries are risk-free it\
00:03:06.000 means that people pile into them\
00:03:08.000 whenever there's a problem and it means\
00:03:10.000 that we can borrow super cheaply when\
00:03:12.000 everything else is really expensive and\
00:03:14.000 we we saw that during covid we saw that\
00:03:16.000 during the financial crisis where it was\
00:03:18.000 essentially free for the government to\
00:03:20.000 borrow and that privilege is so powerful\
00:03:22.000 because it means we can Finance\
00:03:24.000 ourselves that much cheaply out of\
00:03:26.000 disasters that the rest of the world\
00:03:28.000 faces a much more expensive job having\
00:03:30.000 to deal with okay so so treasury markets\
00:03:32.000 you you mentioned that these things are\
00:03:34.000 traded a lot these things are traded a\
00:03:36.000 lot the standard Spiel that you will\
00:03:38.000 read on any New York fed or any US\
00:03:40.000 Treasury document about the treasury\
00:03:42.000 market is that it's the deepest and most\
00:03:44.000 liquid Market in the world that is a\
00:03:46.000 Spiel and that what that means is that\
00:03:48.000 when you buy a treasury when you lend\
00:03:50.000 money to the US government you should be\
00:03:52.000 able to trade that claim super easily\
00:03:54.000 super cheaply and very very stable\
00:03:56.000 prices and that means that no one is\
00:03:58.000 taking on a whole bunch of worry when\
00:04:00.000 they lend money to the US government\
00:04:02.000 they know that if they need to liquidate\
00:04:04.000 if they need to turn it into Cash they\
00:04:06.000 can do that super easily and because of\
00:04:08.000 how how easy it is to get out of these\
00:04:10.000 things how easy it is to trade um in and\
00:04:12.000 out of treasuries that makes them useful\
00:04:14.000 right like they start to show up other\
00:04:16.000 places can you help me understand where\
00:04:18.000 treasuries show up that's not just their\
00:04:20.000 own Market it's an incredible question\
00:04:22.000 so the entire Financial system stability\
00:04:24.000 that we have today depends on us\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\sl324\slmult1\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs28 \cf2 00:04:22.000 it is the most incredibly powerful asset\
00:04:24.000 that is the anchor for the global financial markets to stay in one piece.\
00:04:26.000 Essentially, so Regulators have felt that this is the perfect asset to make into\
00:04:28.000 the safest asset that Financial firms can keep, and since 2008\'962010,\
00:04:30.000 they\'92ve really doubled down on this assumption. They have made every regulated\
00:04:32.000 Financial firm keep a whole buffer of treasuries within their coffers,\
00:04:34.000 in order to maintain their own institutional stability. That\'92s a key part of the post-crisis\
00:04:36.000 Financial architecture. I don\'92t think I really understood that as like it is a doubling down\'97like before\
00:04:38.000 it was sort of like the market had agreed to some extent; it was more that the market had agreed that we all\
00:04:40.000 love this asset the most, and it\'92s the risk-free asset and we benchmark everything off of it.\
00:04:42.000 But in the post-crisis regulation, it became more codified.\
00:04:44.000 That became incredibly codified. The Dodd-Frank Act, for example, has a number of Provisions\
00:04:46.000 that speak to firms maintaining high-quality liquid assets. The best kind of HQAA, it\'92s called,\
00:04:48.000 high-quality liquid assets, alongside cash is a treasury.\
00:04:50.000 It\'92s treated equivalent to cash, even though it\'92s not equivalent, but is treated equivalent to cash,\
00:04:52.000 which means that banks, hedge funds, mutual funds\'97you name it\'97funds have to keep a bunch of\
00:04:54.000 treasuries in order to comply with that regulation. And that\'92s not all.\
00:04:56.000 Essentially, what has also happened is in the case of the private agreements that financial firms make with each other,\
00:04:58.000 so, Mary, if you and I are financial firms and we are borrowing and lending to each other,\
00:05:00.000 we don\'92t want to do a whole bunch of due diligence because we don\'92t have the time,\
00:05:02.000 so we\'92re like, you know what, I\'92ll lend you that money and you give me treasuries as collateral,\
00:05:04.000 which means I don\'92t have to do a whole bunch of investigation on you.\
00:05:06.000 I don\'92t have to spend a ton of time looking at your FICO score and whatnot.\
00:05:08.000 I\'92ll just know that I have the treasuries as collateral, I can sell them, and I\'92ll be okay in the event that you default.\
00:05:10.000 So treasuries as collateral have become a key part of how private interactions within the financial markets are conducted\
00:05:12.000 and how private parties keep themselves safe in credit relationships.\
00:05:14.000 Now, there\'92s one market in particular that\'92s very, very, very powerful at doing this, and it\'92s called\
00:05:16.000 the market for repurchase contracts or the repo market. And that\'92s a lifeline for financial firms\
00:05:18.000 where they are lending to each other on a very short-term basis.\
00:05:20.000 It\'92s how they live every single day, and this market is not regulated in a very prescriptive way.\
00:05:22.000 It\'92s regulated through the fact of having collateralization,\
00:05:24.000 and that\'92s dependent on the US Treasury being default-free and being highly liquid.\
00:05:26.000 Okay, so how many trillions of dollars are we talking in the repurchase market?\
00:05:28.000 It\'92s shrunk a little bit, but last time I checked, it was approximately $4.5 trillion\
00:05:30.000 in the bilateral repo market where they\'92re interacting with each other.\
00:05:32.000 You know, different components vary in how much they use treasuries, but approximately,\
00:05:34.000 it\'92s around 67 to 70% of all transactions in this market are collateralized through treasuries.\
00:05:36.000 How many treasuries are there outstanding, and how many are used as collateral?\
00:05:38.000 And how does it\'97like, are they floating around, like where are they?\
00:05:40.000 That is an impossible question. Very hard question.\
00:05:42.000 And the reason for that is that we don\'92t really know.\
00:05:44.000 And I would tell you something that might freak you out a little bit, which is that regulators themselves don\'92t monitor\
00:05:46.000 how treasuries are collateralized within this different borrowing and lending market that financial firms use\'97the repo market.\
00:05:48.000 And in fact, what tends to happen is that a single treasury is collateralized multiple times.\
00:05:50.000 Oh no. So one treasury is used multiple times?\
00:05:52.000 Yes, for multiple different debts.\
00:05:54.000 Now, there\'92s great work coming out of the IMF. Manan Singh, Dr. Manan Singh does this work,\
00:05:56.000 and what he has posited is that one treasury is being used three times to collateralize debt.\
00:05:58.000 Like at once?\
00:06:00.000 Potentially at once, yeah.\
00:06:02.000 Doesn\'92t that mean if one person defaults, they\'92re like, \'93Give me that Treasury,\'94\
00:06:04.000 and the other person\'92s like, \'93Oh, I don\'92t actually have it. It\'92s over there,\'94\
00:06:06.000 and then the other person\'92s like, \'93I too don\'92t have it,\'94 and there\'92s no reporting mechanism,\
00:06:08.000 so no one really can trace these things either?\
00:06:10.000 For once, I\'92m like pro-blockchain all of a sudden.\
00:06:12.000 I was thinking the same thing. I was like, \'93Wait, you know what?\
00:06:14.000 Let\'92s just put it in the blockchain. It would really solve something for once.\'94\
00:06:16.000 I don\'92t know why\'97\
00:06:18.000 We have a use case, finally!\
00:06:20.000 Oh, people are going to be so excited when they hear this.\
00:06:22.000 Okay, so without the blockchain, so that seems bad and like an inherent fragility that we don\'92t know about.\
00:06:24.000 Are there other ways\'97like, the thing that I feel like about treasuries, and you\'92ve sort of talked about this already a little bit,\
00:06:26.000 but like, it seems to me like they\'92re everywhere in ways that I don\'92t know.\
00:06:28.000 Like, they\'92re collateralized, they\'92re like showing up in other, like repo\'97are there other places that I don\'92t know about\
00:06:30.000 that they\'92re sneaking around?\
00:06:32.000 You know, when you have your 401k, the mutual fund invests a whole chisel ton in treasuries.\
00:06:34.000 They put a whole bunch of the money that they get into these prime funds, which are treasury funds.\
00:06:36.000 And the reason why a whole bunch of these mutual funds do that kind of thing is because it\'92s safe, right?\
00:06:38.000 And so what that means is that it\'92s safe and it\'92s liquid. Treasuries are also desirable,\
00:06:40.000 so they can lend them out if they have to.\
00:06:42.000 But you know, this is the way in which we provide our financial services, and we take for granted the fact\
00:06:44.000 that we can use treasuries to balance our portfolios, have this super safe layer here,\
00:06:46.000 and ultimately what this is doing is unlocking the credit, unlocking the liquidity that we all need,\
00:06:48.000 in order for the banks to give us the loans, for the mutual funds to then be able to invest\
00:06:50.000 in potentially riskier assets, because they have the segment that is also super safe,\
00:06:52.000 that we can then, you know, have this borrowing within the marketplace,\
00:06:54.000 that allows us to essentially get our life the way that we have it and that we become used to.\
00:06:56.000 So treasuries as the lynchpin that unlocks that credit\'97that makes so much sense.\
00:06:58.000 So it\'92s kind of, it feels like it\'92s like this invisible agreement that we\'92ve\
00:06:58.000 all made that like\
00:07:00.000 if we can just agree that a treasury is\
00:07:02.000 a treasury is a treasury and we all\
00:07:04.000 think it\'92s perfectly safe then we can\
00:07:06.000 operate in our day-to-day, but if we have\
00:07:08.000 to start questioning a treasury, the\
00:07:10.000 whole thing falls down. If we\'92re starting\
00:07:12.000 to question the treasury, this officially\
00:07:14.000 becomes like The Avengers blip, right? Like,\
00:07:16.000 you know, this is the only way that I can envision it.\
00:07:18.000 Um, that we are just blipped, um, and the world as we know it\
00:07:20.000 does not look the same.\
00:07:22.000 And if we have politicians that are\
00:07:24.000 potentially playing, you know, pickleball\
00:07:26.000 with a nuclear weapon economically, then\
00:07:28.000 we are not safe.\

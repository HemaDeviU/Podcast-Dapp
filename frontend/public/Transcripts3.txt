00:00:02.000 I definitely think the censorship on the\
00:00:04.000 /r/bitcoin subreddit is very unfortunate.\
00:00:06.000 And I do think it's very contrary to the kind\
00:00:08.000 of values that we want to have and support in\
00:00:10.000 the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.\
00:00:12.000 \
00:00:14.000 So for example if you look at the most recent\
00:00:16.000 Bitcoin Cash hardfork, basically all discussion\
00:00:18.000 of it was banned and it was replaced with one\
00:00:20.000 single thread where they called Bitcoin Cash\
00:00:22.000 "Bcash". This is a deliberate tactic to try and\
00:00:24.000 make it sound like this is just an altcoin and\
00:00:26.000 it's something that's not very connected to\
00:00:28.000 Bitcoin. You see a lot of smaller examples of\
00:00:30.000 this sort of thing.\
00:00:32.000 \
00:00:34.000 So I do believe that there's a lot of people in\
00:00:36.000 both the Bitcoin ecosystem and many other crypto\
00:00:38.000 ecosystems, that are definitely not happy about\
00:00:40.000 this sort of thing.\
